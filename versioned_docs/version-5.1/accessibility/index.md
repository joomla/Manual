Accessibility
=======================
Accessibility is a main concern of Joomla!. 
Find here Joomla's accessibility Statement https://www.joomla.org/accessibility-statement.html.

Joomla! is an accessible Authoring Tool (ATAG). https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/

It enables developers to build accessible sites which are WCAG 2.1 AA compliant from a backend which itself is WCAG 2.1 AA compliant. 
We follow the international Standards of the World Wide Web Consortium for Web Accessibilty https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/

Reporting Accessibilty Issues
=============================
Joomla encourages everyone to report accessibility issues in backend and the template which is shipped with Joomla Core.  
For reporting issues in code, we have a special issue template on github or the possibilties mentioned in the accessibility statement.

Writing accessible Extensions
============================
Extension developers are urged to adhere to the recommendations for accessible design and code.
