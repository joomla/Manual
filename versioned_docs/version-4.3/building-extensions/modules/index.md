Modules are lightweight and flexible extensions. They are used for small bits of the webpage which are positioned around the main component for that page. They are generally less complex than components and can be positioned on the webpages of different components.

You can see many examples of modules in the in the `modules` folder of the standard Joomla install: for example, Menus, Latest News and Login form.
