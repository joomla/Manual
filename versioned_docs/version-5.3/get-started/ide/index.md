IDE
===
To develop a Joomla extension we recommend that you use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE has many benefits:
- Code completion
  - Getting suggestions for code completion which saves researching existing code and helps avoid errors
  - Auto-implementing namespace usage
  - Type hinting when using well documented classes, methods and functions
  - Enhances readability with color-coded syntax for different languages.
  - Building auto comments for classes/methods/functions
- Debugging & Error Detection
  - Offers symbolic debugging to help identify and fix issues faster.
  - Displays real-time warnings and suggestions for improvement.
- Code analyser & Quality Checks
  - Automate code style feedback
  - Hints for "smelling code" to improve the code quality
- Version Control Integration
  - Seamlessly integrates with Git to track changes and manage repositories.
- Project & Folder Management
  - Organizes extension and Joomla core files effectively.
  - Allows multi-folder management for large-scale projects.
- Built-in Terminal
  - Enables running Composer, NPM, and Joomla CLI commands directly.
- Many addons/support for daily coding

The two current leading IDEs are:
- [Visual Studio Code](/get-started/ide/visual-studio-code.md)
  - Lightweight and highly customizable with extensions.
  - Built-in Git support, debugging, and IntelliSense for PHP, JavaScript, and CSS.
  - Extensions like PHP Intelephense, Joomla Snippets, and Joomla API Helper enhance Joomla development.

- [phpStorm](/get-started/ide/phpstorm/index.md)
  - Advanced PHP IDE with deep code analysis and powerful refactoring tools.
  - Provides built-in tools for database management, version control, and debugging.
  - Supports Joomla-specific coding assistance and inspections.
 
You donâ€™t need an IDE to develop for Joomla, but it can make your life a lot easier. Whether you go with VS Code for its flexibility or PhpStorm for its power, the right IDE will help you write better code, faster.
