The **folderlist** form field type provides a drop down list of folders from a specified directory.
saved value this is selected when the page is first loaded. If not, the default value (if any) is selected.

By default, the first item on the list is '- None Selected -' (which is translatable) and is given the value '-1' and this
is followed by '- Use Default -' (also translatable) given the value '0'.

- **type** (mandatory) must be *folderlist*.
- **name** (mandatory) is the unique name of the field.
- **label** (mandatory) (translatable) is the field html label.
- **directory** (mandatory) is the filesystem path to the directory containing the folders to be listed.
- **description** (optional) (translatable) is the [field description](../standard-form-field-attributes.md#description).
- **default** (optional) is the default folder name.
- **filter** (Joomla 3.x) or **fileFilter** (Joomla 4.0 and later) (optional) is a regular expression string which is
  used to filter the list of folders selected for inclusion in the drop-down list. If omitted, all folders in the
  directory are included. The filter argument expression is applied before the exclude argument expression. For
  information on constructing regular expressions
  see [Regular expressions](https://docs.joomla.org/Special:MyLanguage/J1.5:Regular_expressions_in_parameter_arguments)
  in parameter arguments.
- **exclude** (optional) is a regular expression string which is used to exclude files from the list. The exclude
  argument expression is applied after the filter argument expression. For information on constructing regular

  list.
- **hide_default** (optional) is a Boolean argument. If true, the '- Use Default -' item is omitted from the drop-down
  list.
- **recursive** (optional) is a Boolean argument. If true, the list of folders recursively includes any sub-folders
  found. Caution: If you have a large number of sub-folders this can make page loading slow.
