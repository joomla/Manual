All the new deprecations that should be aware of and what you should now be using instead.

# Language strings

File: `administrator/language/en-GB/com_content.ini`

Strings will be removed in 6.0: 
* `COM_CONTENT_RUN_TRANSITION`, use `JWORKFLOW_RUN_TRANSITION` instead 
* `COM_CONTENT_WORKFLOW_STAGE`, use `JWORKFLOW_STAGE` instead 

# Class deprecations

Planned to be removed in Joomla! 7.0.

### Banner component helper

File: components/com_banners/src/Helper/BannerHelper.php
Replacement: BannerHelper::isImage() has been replaced with MediaHelper::isImage($url) to avoid duplicated code.
