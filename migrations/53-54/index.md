Joomla 5.3 to 5.4 Upgrade Notes
===============================

An explanation of the code changes from Joomla version 5.3 to Joomla version 5.4.

* One of the most significant new features in Joomla 5.4 is the introduction of automated core updates,
  enabling Joomla to keep itself up to date without any user intervention. See the [New features](new-features) section.
* Some methods, a property and a language string have been set as deprecated.
  The details can be found in the [New deprecations](new-deprecations) section.
* New in Joomla 5.4 is the '*Behaviour - Backward Compatibility 6*' plugin.
  For this and the still-existing Joomla 4 to 5 compatibility plugin,
  see the [Compatibility Plugins](compat-plugins) section.
