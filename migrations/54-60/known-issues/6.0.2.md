Joomla 6.0.2 Known Issues
=========================

Last Updated: 16 January 2026

[Joomla 6.0.2](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/releases/tag/6.0.2) was released on 6 January 2026.
If it is installed, then you have received it either via Automatic Updates or by manually updating your Joomla website.

## Issue [46643](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/46643) – Mailer setSender() does not work

A regression was introduced by Pull Request [46431](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/issues/46431).
If your code or a third-party extension uses:
```
$mailer->setSender(...)
```

the provided email address is ignored, and Joomla instead uses the global configuration value “From Email”.

As a result, the sender and recipient email addresses may become identical.
This has been reported to cause email delivery failures,
as some mail servers reject messages where sender and receiver are the same.

### Resolution

This issue will be resolved in Joomla 6.0.3 by reverting the change introduced in PR 46431.
The scheduled release date is 17 February 2026.

### Workaround (Before Joomla 6.0.3)

If you need an immediate fix, you can manually revert the affected file.

1. Download the file from Joomla 6.0.1:  
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joomla/joomla-cms/6.0.1/libraries/src/Mail/MailerFactory.php
2. Overwrite the following file in your Joomla installation:
   `libraries/src/Mail/MailerFactory.php`

This restores the correct behaviour of `setSender()` until Joomla 6.0.3 is released.
