## Joomla 5 Compatibility Plugin

As part of Joomla! 5.0 a plugin was introduced which enhance backward compatibility between Joomla 5 and 4. 
Please check the [Backward Compatibility Plugin](https://manual.joomla.org/migrations/44-50/compat-plugin.md) for more details.

For more detail check [Compatibility Plugin Joomla! 5.0](https://manual.joomla.org/migrations/44-50/compat-plugin).

## Joomla 6 Compatibility Plugin

In Joomla! 6.0 the Compatibility Plugin introduced in Joomla! 5.0 will be replaced by a new plugin
called "Behaviour - Backward Compatibility 6".

Despite the warning about the potential removal of the `behaviour` plugin type, this compatibility plugin still uses
this type to ensure it loads before any other plugin, as this is critical for backward compatibility functionality.
