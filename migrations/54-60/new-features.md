## Filesystem adapter

### Improving large files handling

Starting from 6.0 Media manager introduces new class `TmpFileUpload` that represent temporary file, 
which is a reference to temporary file (that was just uploaded), without keeping whole file in the memory. 
This allows to upload large files without violation PHP max_memory limits.

Note: Media API calls still handle base64 encoded images, which still uses PHP memory directly.

It is recommended to update existing Filesystem Adapter:
```php
// Before:
public function createFile(string $name, string $path, $data): string
{
    ...
    File::write($dstPath, $data);
    ...
}

// After:
public function createFile(string $name, string $path, $data): string
{
    ...
    if ($data instanceof TmpFileUpload) {
        File::upload($data->getUri(), $dstPath);
    } else {
        File::write($dstPath, $data);
    }    
    ...
}

// Or:
public function createFile(string $name, string $path, $data): string
{
    ...
    if ($data instanceof TmpFileUpload) {
        $data = fopen($data->getUri(), 'r');
    }
    
    File::write($dstPath, $data);
    ...
}
```
The same for `updateFile()` method.
