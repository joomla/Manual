# Removed and backward incompatibility

:::tip[Developer Note]
  Since this version of Joomla has not been released yet, this page can change anytime.
:::

All the deprecated features than have now been removed and any backward incompatibilities.
There should be an explanation of how to mitigate the removals / changes.

### CMS Input object switched to Framework Input object

- PR: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/42805
- Description: The CMS Input object `\Joomla\CMS\Input` has been deprecated since Joomla 4.3. The CMS core code has switched the code to the Framework Input object `\Joomla\Input`, which is very much a drop-in replacement. This is especially of relevance if you are using the MVC classes, which now use the framework class. Make sure that your code imports the correct class.

### CMS BaseApplication and CLI classes have been removed

- PR: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/42884
- Description: The class `\Joomla\CMS\Application\BaseApplication` and the CMS CLI Application classes have been deprecated since Joomla 4.3. The CMS core code has been switched to use the Application package of the Joomla Framework.
