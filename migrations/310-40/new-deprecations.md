New deprecations
===============

Joomla! 4.0 is a special version which introduces a new timebased release cycle. This
cycle allow us to remove old code every 2 years. Based on motion 
[PROD2022/011](https://volunteers.joomla.org/departments/production/reports/1793-production-dept-meeting-minutes-august-23-2022)
we keep deprecations for at least one major version. For this we retagged all deprecation
which are introduced in 4.0 with version 4.3. That means we don't have many deprecations left
for 4.0 and you can find all relevant deprecations introduced in 4.0 at [4.3 deprecations](../42-43/new-deprecations.md).
