Support Namespace for Templates
-------------------------------

Starting with Joomla! 4.3 it's possible to set a namespace for the template. This
namespace is used for autoloading helper classes located in the folder provided
in the path attribute of the manifest xml file.

Suggest Namespace:
XML: `Vendorname\Template\TemplateName` Path Attribute: `src`   
PHP: `Vendorname\Template\TemplateName\Site` Location: `templates/TemplateName/src`
