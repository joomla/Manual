New deprecations
===============
All the new deprecations that should be aware of and what you should now be using instead.
:::caution TODO

This page is unfinished, please use the **Edit this Page** link at the bottom of this page to help make it more useful.

:::

#### Workflow requires database and application

File: libraries/src/Workflow/Workflow.php
Replacement: The application and database will be mandatory
Example:
```php
$workflow = new Workflow($extension, $app, $db);
```

File: libraries/src/MVC/Model/WorkflowBehaviorTrait.php
Replacement: The trait requires a getDatabase function which is provided by the Joomla\Database\DatabaseAwareTrait trait so it is recommended to use both traits together. If you are using the workflow trait in a model, then the database trait is already available.
Example:
```php
class Foo {
  use MVC/Model/WorkflowBehaviorTrait;
  use Joomla\Database\DatabaseAwareTrait;
}
```

#### countMenuChildren in HtmlDocument is deprecated

File: libraries/src/Document/HtmlDocument.php
Replacement: Load the active menu item directly from the application and count the children with the php `count` function.
Example:
```php
$app->getMenu()->getActive() ? count($app->getMenu()->getActive()->getChildren()) : 0;
```

#### com_search-specific methods in Language are deprecated

File: libraries/src/Language/Language.php
Replacement: com_search will not be supported in Joomla 6.0 anymore and there is no replacement for these methods.

#### JPATH_PLATFORM variable is deprecated

File: libraries/bootstrap.php
Replacement: The variable `JPATH_PLATFORM` should not be used anymore to check if the CMS is correctly initialized, use `_JEXEC` instead.
Example:
```php
defined('_JEXEC') or die;
```

#### The function emailToPunycode in the PunycodeHelper class is not accepting null values

File: libraries/src/String/PunycodeHelper.php
Replacement: The function throws a deprecated message when a `NULL` email address is passed to the function.

#### The aid property of the User class is deprecated

File: libraries/src/User/User.php
Replacement: The $aid property will be removed with no replacement as the user roles are defined through an access level.
