4.4 to 5.0
==========
An explanation of the code changes for each version of Joomla.
If you follow from the version of your current code until the version you want
to support you should come across all the changes you need to make.

# Compatibility Plugin

Most of the code deprecated in Joomla! 3.x has been removed. Some deprecations have been moved
to the [Compatibility Plugin](compat-plugin.md).

# Replacement of Factory::getUser
`Factory::getUser()` is deprecated since Joomla 4.0. To replace it, models, views, form fields and tables can implement the `CurrentUserInterface` and then is the currently logged in user available through `$this->getCurrentUser()`.

In 5.0 are all the template files (default.php) changed from `Factory::getUser()` to `$this->getCurrentUser()`.
