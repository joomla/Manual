:::caution TODO

This page is unfinished, please use the **Edit this Page** link at the bottom of this page to help make it more useful.

:::


#### The item_associations property of the WebApplication class is deprecated

File: libraries/src/Application/WebApplication.php
Replacement: The $item_associations property will be removed with no replacement as it is not used in core anymore.

#### Privacy plugin db property is deprecated

File: administrator/components/com_privacy/src/Plugin/PrivacyPlugin.php
Replacement: The `$this->db` property is deprecated in the privacy plugins. Instead of use `$this->getDatabase()` when the plugin is converted to service providers.

#### Model states are not anymore of type CMSObject

File: libraries/src/MVC/Model/StateBehaviorTrait.php
Replacement: Direct property access to the state object of the model should be replaced with a get/set function call. The state object is now a `Registry` which contains all the convenient functions a store should provide.
Example:
```php
// Write to the state
$model->getState()->set('foo', 'bar');

// Access the state
$data = $model->getState()->get('foo');
```
