### Database must be injected in constructor model
- PR: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/38511
- Description: The database instance in the model should be injected through the `$this->setDatabase()` or the deprecated function `$this->setDbo()`  configuration in the constructor to make it available in the base class. Like that it is ensured that calls to `$this->getDatabase()` and the deprecated function `$this->getDbo()` will point to the same instance.

```php
class MyModel extends ListModel {
  public function __construct(..) {
    parent::__construct(...);
    $this->setDatabase(MyHelper::getGridDB());
  }
}
```
