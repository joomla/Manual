### PSR-3 upgraded to version 3

The PSR-3 (Logging) is upgraded to [version 3](https://github.com/php-fig/log/tree/3.0.0) of the specification.

Most critically, the signature of the `\Psr\Log\LoggerInterface` methods has changed. The `$message` argument is now strongly typed as `string|\Stringable`. Any logger implementation you use **must** be compatible with this new signature. This is relevant to you if you implement your own logger, or if you are using a third party logger such as Monolog, in your extension.

If you are using your own logger, you want to preserve compatibility with Joomla 4 and 5 in the same extension package, and you do not mind losing PSR-3 compatibility you can include a copy of PSR-3 in your extension _as long as it's under your extension's namespace_. For example, instead of using `\Psr\Log\LoggerInterface` you could use `\Acme\Component\Example\Administrator\Log\LoggerInterface`. Note that you can use [PHP Scoper](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper) to easily migrate your dependencies under your own namespace.

If you only need to maintain compatibilty with PSR-3 to use an logger external to your component, such as Joomla's logger, you can still typehint against `\Psr\Log\LoggerInterface`. Please note that the external logger you are using must be compatible with PSR-3 version 1 on Joomla 4 and PSR-3 version 3 on Joomla 5. If you are providing a third party, external logger yourself you may need to include two versions of the logger with your extension and only load the correct one for each Joomla version.

### Framework Update

Joomla! 5.0 uses the Joomla! Framework 3.0, this might have it own breaking changes:

- Dependency Container:  
  PR: https://github.com/joomla-framework/di/pull/48
  Description: It is possible to override services in child containers. This allows to override protected services, like the form factory one, in the containers of an extension when they are booted.


### Database must be injected in constructor model
- PR: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/38511
- Description: The database instance in the model should be injected through the `$this->setDatabase()` or the deprecated function `$this->setDbo()`  configuration in the constructor to make it available in the base class. Like that it is ensured that calls to `$this->getDatabase()` and the deprecated function `$this->getDbo()` will point to the same instance.

```php
class MyModel extends ListModel {
  public function __construct(..) {
    parent::__construct(...);
    $this->setDatabase(MyHelper::getGridDB());
  }
}
```

### CSS removals
The CSS class ".ie11" was removed [via PR #39018](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/pull/39018)


### Return Types
All return types have been updated to match the PHP 8.1 return type signatures. This addresses any class utilising the ArrayAccess, Datetime or the JsonSerializable interfaces. If you extend from any of the affected classes and require compatibility with both Joomla 4.x and 5.x you should add the `#[\ReturnTypeWillChange]` annotation to your code.
