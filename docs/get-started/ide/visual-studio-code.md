Visual Studio Code
==================

## Indentation with Spaces
Joomla uses spaces for indentation. Many people struggle to see the code nesting when the indentation is with spaces instead of tabs. The tab width can be adjusted in the ide but for spaces it is not as simple and you will need to use an extension to provide this functionality. It's not about how it looks, it's about how the brain works and how much time it spends to see nesting.

For Visual Studio Code you can use [Stretchy Spaces]([https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14849-elastic-indents](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kylepaulsen.stretchy-spaces&ssr=false#overview) to adjust the visual width of spaced indents and to come close to the benefits of tabbed indentations.
