IDE
===
To develop a Joomla extension we recommend that you use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE has many benefits:
- Code completion
  - Getting suggestions for code completion which saves researching existing code and helps avoid errors
  - Auto-implementing namespace usage
  - Type hinting when using well documented classes, methods and functions
  - Building auto comments for classes/methods/functions
- Code analyser
  - Automate code style feedback
  - Hints for "smelling code" to improve the code quality
- Project/Folder management for extension projects
- Many addons/support for daily coding

The two current leading IDEs are [Visual Studio Code](get-started/ide/visual-studio-code.md) and [phpStorm](get-started/ide/phpstorm.md)
