### Glossar

#### Recommended

This column describes which version the Joomla! Project recommends to use for the selected Joomla version.

#### Minimum

This column describes which version the Joomla! Project has set as the minimum supported version.
This means any bug found in this version or higher will be considered for fixing. This version might
not be enforced. The minimum version usually reflects the latest version of the software package
supported by the vendor.

#### Required

This column describes the enforced version by the CMS or the framework in use. That means you may use
a lower version than the minimum version, but not lower than the required version. For versions below
the minimum version, you might not receive support from the Joomla maintainers.
