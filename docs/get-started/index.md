## Welcome to the Joomla Developers Manual
The purpose of this guide is to give developers an up to date guide showing best practice in
writing and maintaining Joomla extensions.
It also offers a migration path for extensions from older Joomla! versions to the latest standard.
We will run through the tools and process required to set up a local development environment with
the ability to get the most out of the guide as a developer.
