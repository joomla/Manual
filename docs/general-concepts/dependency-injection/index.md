Dependency Injection was introduced in Joomla 4 to try to enable better testing of the Joomla code. If you're not familiar with the concepts of dependency injection then you may find the following videos useful: [Dependency Injection in PHP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igx3bIl1T_c) and [DI Container](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Vpg97rQwE). The videos are not related to Joomla, but do present good background information.

There are also a couple of Joomla-related videos, covering [Joomla 4 Dependency Injection](https://youtu.be/Y2oe73C1Q54) and [services/provider.php](https://youtu.be/n2fdf2szI_A).
