Using Text Class
================

To translate strings within your code, use the `Text` handling class from Joomla.
The Text class contains six static main methods and one auxiliary method that can be used:

:::note
The key you pass to the ``Text::`` method must match a key defined in the corresponding language file or language
override.
:::

```ìni
MOD_EXAMPLE_HELLO="Hello"
MOD_EXAMPLE_GOODBYE="Goodbye"
```

## Using Text::_

Searches for the defined language string in the current language file and outputs it. Displays the language constant 
in the frontend if no translation was found.

```php
use Joomla\CMS\Language\Text;

// Usage in PHP code
echo Text::_("MOD_EXAMPLE_HELLO");  // Outputs: Hello

echo Text::_("MOD_EXAMPLE_GOODBYE");  // Outputs: Goodbye
```

## Using Text::alt

Searches for the defined language string in the current language and outputs it. The `$alt` option defines where
the translation has to be taken from. Displays the language constant in the frontend if no translation was found.

```ini title="Global"
JALL="All"
```

```ini title="Module Language File"
JALL="All together"
```

```php
use Joomla\CMS\Language\Text;

echo Text::alt('JALL', 'language'); // will generate a 'All' string in English but a "Toutes" string in French
echo Text::alt('JALL', 'module');   // will generate a 'All' string in English but a "Tous" string in French
```

:::info
By default, Joomla! always uses the language file supplied with the extension. It is then also possible to overwrite
global language constants in this file. However, if the global constant is to be used at a certain point in the
extension instead of the overwritten constant and its value, this can be achieved using the Text::alt method.
:::

## Using Text::plural

Automatic use of the correct language constant (pluralised) based on the transferred value.

```php title="mod_example Template File Plural example"
use Joomla\CMS\Language\Text;

echo Text::plural('MOD_EXAMPLE_N_ITEMS_FOUND', 2);
```

```ini title="MOD_EXAMPLE Language File"
MOD_EXAMPLE_N_ITEMS_FOUND="%d items found."
MOD_EXAMPLE_N_ITEMS_FOUND_0="No items found."
MOD_EXAMPLE_N_ITEMS_FOUND_1="Only one item found."
MOD_EXAMPLE_N_ITEMS_FOUND_2="Two items found."
```

```plaintext title="Result"
Two items found.
```

A detailed explanation of the plural method can be found [here](./plural.md).

## Using Text::sprintf

Uses PHP's `sprintf` method in combination with translations to output a translated string. For example, variables can 
be used in a language string and formatted accordingly.

```ini title="Language Strings containing Placeholder for variable"
COM_EXAMPLE_MY_STRING="There's a lot of laundry in the %s."
```

```php title="Calling the translation and transferring a variable"
use Joomla\CMS\Language\Text;

echo Text::sprintf("COM_EXAMPLE_MY_STRING", "laundry basket")
```

```plaintext title="Result"
There's a lot of laundry in the laundry basket.
```

More examples of the use of `sprintf` can be found [here](./using-variables.md).

## Using Text::printf

Like the `sprintf` method, the `printf` method is a wrapper for the standard PHP printf function.
The difference between `printf` and `sprintf` is that printf outputs the corresponding string directly, so no 
**echo** is required.

```php title="Register the language string for JavaScript"
use Joomla\CMS\Language\Text;

Text::printf("COM_EXAMPLE_MY_STRING", "laundry basket")
```

```plaintext title="Result"
There's a lot of laundry in the laundry basket.
```

## Using Text::script

This method is necessary when you need multilingual strings in client-side JavaScript files. With `Text::script`, 
language strings can be passed to JavaScript in the frontend.

**Typical use cases include:**
- Dynamic dialogs/popups (e.g., modal windows) that need to display user messages in the appropriate language.
- Validation messages generated by JavaScript.
- Any custom JavaScript components or UI interactions that rely on localized text.

```ini title="Language File"
COM_EXAMPLE_CONFIRM_DELETE="Are you sure you want to delete this item?"
```

```php title="Register the language string for JavaScript"
use Joomla\CMS\Language\Text;

Text::script('COM_EXAMPLE_CONFIRM_DELETE');
```

```js title="Use the Language Constant in JavaScript"
// Retrieve the registered string in JavaScript
const deleteConfirmText = Joomla.Text._('COM_EXAMPLE_CONFIRM_DELETE');

// Use it in a dialog
alert(deleteConfirmText); // Displays: "Are you sure you want to delete this item?"
```

:::info
There is currently no direct way to use variables within the JavaScript translation, such as with `sprintf` for example. 
Instead, it is possible, to define placeholders within the translation which can then be replaced using JavaScript.
:::

## Using the Text::getScriptStrings Utility

The `Text::getScriptStrings` method in Joomla is a utility that allows you to retrieve an array of all the language 
strings that have been registered for JavaScript using the `Text::script` method. The main purpose of 
`Text::getScriptStrings` is to fetch all the strings that have been registered for use in JavaScript and make them 
accessible in an array format.

```ini title="Language File"
COM_EXAMPLE_CONFIRM_DELETE="Are you sure you want to delete this item?"
COM_EXAMPLE_SUCCESSFULLY_SAVED="The item was successfully saved."
COM_EXAMPLE_ACTION_FAILED="The action failed. Please try again."
```

```php title="Registering multiple strings"
use Joomla\CMS\Language\Text;

Text::script('COM_EXAMPLE_CONFIRM_DELETE');
Text::script('COM_EXAMPLE_SUCCESSFULLY_SAVED');
Text::script('COM_EXAMPLE_ACTION_FAILED');
```

```php title="Retrieve all the registered script strings"
$registeredStrings = Text::getScriptStrings();

// Output the array for debugging or custom processing
print_r($registeredStrings);
```

```php title="Result"
Array
(
    [COM_EXAMPLE_CONFIRM_DELETE] => "Are you sure you want to delete this item?"
    [COM_EXAMPLE_SUCCESSFULLY_SAVED] => "The item was successfully saved."
    [COM_EXAMPLE_ACTION_FAILED] => "The action failed. Please try again."
)
```
