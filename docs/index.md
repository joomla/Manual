Joomla! Programmers Documentation
=================================

## Welcome

This site holds information for developers of Joomla! extensions: components, modules, libraries, plugins and templates. Extensions are sometimes considered to fall into one of two categories:

1. **Joomla! Core extensions** are produced by Joomla and shipped with Joomla installation packages.
2. **Third party extensions** are produced by independent developers and are installed separately.

The people involved are often the same. With the passage of time, independent developers often become core developers and vice-versa. So this documentation should help any kind of developer. Everything needed to understand Joomla code development should be found here.

However, the documentation is new and incomplete. If you would like to contribute you can do so using on of two approaches:

### Simple changes

At the bottom of each page there is an *Edit this page* link. Select the link to go to the page source on GitHub. If you make changes there GitHub will guide you through committing the changes to your fork of the Manual repository on GitHub and then making a pull request.

### Complex changes

Make your own local clone of your own GitHub fork of the Manual and test your changes before making a pull request. There are instructions on how to do this in the [GitHub Example 1: This Manual](./get-started/git/github-manual.md) page.
