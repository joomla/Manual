Template Font Stacks
====================

The use of _Modern Font Stacks_ has been implemented for the Cassiopeia site template in Joomla 5.

## What are System Fonts?
System fonts are the fastest fonts available. No downloading, no layout shifts, no flashes — just instant renders.

However the naming of the available system fonts will vary dependent on the operating system and browser of the visitor.

## What is a Font Stack?
To ensure that the selected font is displayed to all visitors a font stack is used. This is just an ordered list of all the similar fonts and the first font in the "stack" that exists on the vistors computer will be used.

The font displayed may not be 100% identical for all visitors but any differences are minimal. When weighed against the performance limitations imposed by using web fonts the benefits usually outweigh any potential differences.

## Selecting a Font Stack
When selecting a *Font Scheme* in the Cassioeia template style you now have an option to select *System Fonts*. Once selected you are then able to select from a range of *Font Stacks* for both the Heading and the Body.

## Is there a demo of the Font Stack
You can test all the available Font Stacks at the [Modern Fonts web site](https://modernfontstacks.com/#font-stacks)
