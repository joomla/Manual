Accessibility
=======================
Accessibility is a main concern of Joomla!. 
Find here Joomla's accessibility Statement https://www.joomla.org/accessibility-statement.html.

The Joomla Core generates HTML sites which are WCAG 2.1 AA compliant. 
We follow the international Standards of the World Wide Web Consortium for Web Accessibilty https://www.w3.org/WAI/.

The infomation in this chapter enables extension and template developers adapting or writing code and keep accessibilty over the whole site.

Joomla encourages everyone to report accessibility issues. 
For reporting issues in code, we have a special issue template on github or the possibilties mentioned in the accessibility statement.
