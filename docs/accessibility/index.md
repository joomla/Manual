### Why Accessibility Matters: Building Inclusive Joomla Extensions

Everyone should have the opportunity to access, interact with, and benefit from online content—regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Accessibility isn't just a technical requirement; it's a moral imperative that ensures we are building a web that’s truly inclusive. 

For developers working with Joomla, making sure your extensions conform to accessibility standards —specifically WCAG 2.2 AA — is not just about following guidelines. It’s about creating websites and experiences that cater to a diverse audience. When your Joomla extensions are accessible, you’re opening doors for people with visual, auditory, cognitive, or motor impairments, ensuring they can navigate, read, and interact with your content seamlessly.

But why should **you** care? Beyond making a positive impact on users’ lives, accessibility can expand your audience, improve your site’s usability, and even enhance SEO. Search engines favor accessible sites, and many legal frameworks around the world now mandate that digital content be accessible to all. This is more than a trend—it’s a movement towards a more equitable digital landscape.

In this section, we'll explore how to develop Joomla extensions that are fully accessible, following WCAG 2.2 AA guidelines. We will show snippets and examples which enable you to make your extensions accessible and usable.
