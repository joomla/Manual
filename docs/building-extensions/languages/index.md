## Language Packs

Joomla implements multilingual functionality using language packs, the default being British English. Each language pack consists of a number of .ini files for each **core** extension and each client (admin, api or site). There is information on the structure and use of language files in the [Multilingual](../../general-concepts/multilingual/) section of General Concepts in this manual. This section is more concerned with language packs as extensions.

## Language Pack Documentation

There are many parts to the Joomla language system, each needing its own specific documentation. For example:

- Official Language Packs created by translation of the English originals require management code that is not part of the Joomla CMS.
- The actual translation of language packs using Crowdin requires Translator documentation.
- The use of multiple languages in a Joomla site using Associations or Overrides requires User documentation.
- The CMS language debugging feature requires Developer documentation.
- Third party components may offer several languages for which developers need some guidance on best practices.
- There may be circumstances where a Language Pack produced by a third party is not an ***Official*** language pack. An example is described for [Scottish Gaelic](../languages/language-extension-example/) in this section of the Manual.
