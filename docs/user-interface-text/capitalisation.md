DON'T USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT'S QUITE HARD TO READ.

Sentence case is preferable but use capitalisation for:

* Menu Items  
* Labels  
* Buttons  

Do not capitalise joining words and words of three characters or less such as and, to, for.

#### Examples
* Show Intro Text  
* Position of Article Info
