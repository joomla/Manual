The official language of Joomla is en-GB and this guide is intended to assist anyone writing language strings in en-GB (British English). This guide should not be translated but may help serve as a starting point for Translation Teams to localise and produce their own guide.

### Purpose
* Establish official style guidelines for writing en-GB strings.
* Ensure consistency throughout Joomla.
* Traditional rules of grammar do not always apply to the web. See [Break Grammar Rules on Websites for Clarity](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/break-grammar-rules/).
* See [NNG on American vs British english for the web](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/american-vs-british-english-for-web/).

### Target audience
* Primary: Developers writing en-GB strings.
* Secondary: Translation teams.

### Uses
* Primary: Basis for all en-GB strings.
* Secondary: Assist non native en-GB developers writing language strings in en-GB.
* Tertiary: Provide guidelines for translation teams to localise.	

### Notes
#### Avoid over-communication
Be explicit wherever necessary but don't explain the obvious. On the web scanning is the norm and too much text weakens the effectiveness of the message - it does not enhance it.
