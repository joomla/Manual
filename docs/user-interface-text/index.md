# Joomla User Interface Text Guidelines
A repository for the en-GB style guide of Joomla! language strings.

## Meta Information
The documentation in this repository is optimised for display in the [user interface text guidelines section](https://developer.joomla.org/en-gb-user-interface-text-guidelines.html) of the Joomla! Developer Network. When formatting and proposing changes to this documentation, please keep the following in mind:

- Heading levels should start at `<h3>`
- The document title does NOT need to be included in the document, these are displayed as the page heading based on the Joomla component configuration and would result in duplicated titles if included
- Because the GitHub Markdown parser interprets line breaks as `<br>` tags, arbitrary line breaks to keep lines from becoming too long should not be used
- Links to documents in this manual should be formatted for use on the Joomla! Developer Network, such as `[a link to the punctuation page](/en-gb-user-interface-text-guidelines/punctuation.html)`
