# Code Blocks

[Code blocks](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/markdown-features/code-blocks) are enclosed in 3 backticks, and can have a title:

```php title="hello.php"
public static function hello() 
{
    echo "Hello!"; 
}
```

Line numbering and highlighting of individual lines are also supported.

To aid readability of the markdown please leave a blank line before and after code blocks.
